#Bear Claw
The browser testing utility I always wanted: Open a whole bunch of URLs in as many browers as you like with one quick command

## Usage
Bearclaw requires Ruby.

This projie is in ultra-hyper-mega-alpha. That said, if you want to give it a little test run it with   
```ruby bearclaw.rb```   
If you like it, make it executable with a little ```chmod + x bearclaw.rb```   
Drop the .rb (if you like) and put it somewhere in your path. 

If you're using it I'd enjoy hearing what you think.
